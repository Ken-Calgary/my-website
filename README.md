# My Personal Website
A personal website for myself, enjoyed my time making a website while chilling for the weeks to come.
If you have any questions, concerns or what not, you can email me at: kenyjliu@gmail.com, see everyone around :). 

P.S. Need to fix it for mobile view, otherviews and what not, will work on that on a later date.
